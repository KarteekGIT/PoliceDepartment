This is the project which I finished as intern in web developement. 
I used html, php, javascript, ajax, jquery, mysql, css. 
This is not the latest version.
I am unable to include the latest version because my company dinied access to the latest version.
This is just a prototype.
I worked past 3 days from date 21-Dec-2016 on it to add some features like PDO(PHP Data Objects) and table paginations. 
I added this project to repository just to showcase my php skills.
Application will create only one PDO object and one session object for each user.
I used PDO's to minimise the risk of sql injections and cross side scripting.
But i still need to work on minimising sql injections that masks PDO objects.
Please check the appimages folder to understand the behaviour of application.
